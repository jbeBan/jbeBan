# Hello!

## My name is Jacob BaÃ±uelos, and welcome to my GitHub profile!

ðŸŽ“ I am currently a Junior at Utah Valley University studying for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I love learning and teaching people how to program. After I graduate with my B.S. in CS, I plan on pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science. Right now, I am learning SQL along with PostgreSQL.

ðŸ‘€ Feel free to take a look around and add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-banuelos).
