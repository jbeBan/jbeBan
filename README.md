# Hello!

## My name is Jacob BaÃ±uelos, and welcome to my GitHub profile.

ðŸŽ“ I'm currently a Senior at Utah Valley University studying for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I have a passion for learning and teaching people how to program, as well as an interest in Programming Language Theory. After I graduate with my B.S. in CS, I plan on pursuing a Master's in Computer Science in the near future.

ðŸ‘€ Feel free to take a look around and add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-banuelos).
