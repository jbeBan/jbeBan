# Hello!

## My name is Jacob BaÃ±uelos, and welcome to my GitHub profile.

ðŸŽ“ As a software engineer working on web applications and a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, I enjoy bringing beautiful user interfaces and pleasant user experiences to life through programming. I also have a passion for learning and teaching others to program, as well as an interest in Programming Language Theory. In the near future, I would like to pursue a Master of Science in Computer Science to gain a specialization in a specific field, along with research experience.

ðŸ‘€ Feel free to take a look around and add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-banuelos).
